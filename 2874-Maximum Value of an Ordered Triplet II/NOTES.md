**See hints in the question**.
I already did the question using the right max_value_sufix array in O(n^2)
for each i I was finding j and getting k index as j+1 from   right max_value_sufix array

To Optimize it we just need to run a loop for valid j and find max i and max k to satisfy the given condition
